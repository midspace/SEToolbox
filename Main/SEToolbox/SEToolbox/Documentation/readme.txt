TODO: list of tasks
- Check if SpaceEngineers Game is installed first.
- Double the Voxel shell thickness and double count of 3D objects, and use this to generate the slopes/corners/inversecorners instead of trying to interpret them.
- Refresh/Save needs to check if save directory no longer exists.

Why are the blocks 0.5 and 2.5 meter blocks?
Sectors have the same size as in Miner Wars: 50x50x50km. It would take a couple of minutes to get from one border to the other.
