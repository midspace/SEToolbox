Why are the blocks 0.5 and 2.5 meter blocks?
Sectors have the same size as in Miner Wars: 50x50x50km. It would take a couple of minutes to get from one border to the other.

TODO: list of tasks
- Double the Voxel shell thickness and double count of 3D objects, and use this to generate the slopes/corners/inversecorners instead of trying to interprete them.
- Refresh/Save needs to check if save directory no longer exists.
- tree view.
- Property Grid.
- Close Dialog on IsModified.
- Wix installer project,
  * Desktop Icon.

- Improve Import Image:
  * Preview.
  * Scale.
- Improve Import 3D Model:
  * Recode Poly2Vox to VisualC CLR to integrate with app, and enhance.
  * 3D Preview?
- Link to open Workshop ID?

- Exit Pilot from ship to Astronaught.
- Set/Reset Astronaught Vector. (Direction and Speed)
- Move Astronaught to position.
- Switch Jetpack on/off.
- Switch initerial Stablizers on/off.

- Import multiple ships/stations/objects from another 'world' as a group.  (Required to keep attached items. ie, Station/asteroid, Large Carrier/fighters.)
  Need a way to detect attached landing skids, or overlapping objects (sigh).  Check if landing gear actived?

- Import Asteroid/Voxel.
- Replace Asteroid/Voxel.
- Move Asteroid/Voxel.

- Show ship status. Size. Item count. Weight. Thrust.
- Switch power on/off.
- Switch initerial Stablizers on/off.
- Set/Reset Ship Vector. (Direction and Speed)
- Move Ship to position.
- Replace Armor light/heavy/color.


Completed:
- Refresh button, to reload selected Sandbox content.
- Change Astronaught color.
- Import Image.
- Import 3D model.
- Delete ship/station/object.
- Show Ship Pilot/Roaming Astronaught status.
- Repair ship.


Dropped:
- Obfuscate/dotfuscator. Don't think it's worth it, considering I've gone open source. :D
- Text Unicode support. SpaceEngineers doesn't appear to support Unicode.
