TODO: list of tasks (in no particular order):
- All the TODO: items in code!
- Documentation.... lots of it to be added to CodePlex.
- Close Dialog on IsModified.
- Wix installer project,
  * Desktop Icon.
- View subscribed workshop Items (to allow exporting/copying from).
  * C:\Users\%Username%\AppData\Roaming\SpaceEngineers\WorkshopWorlds\*.sbw  These are .zip files.
  * It's not until the user presses "Copy & Load" that it's actually saved there.
  * The workshopId may or may not be present, depending on if it is the first version, or a subsequent upload by the author.
- Multi lingual support.

- Global:
  * Refresh/Save needs to check if save directory no longer exists.
  * tree view of everything.
  * Property Grid, to edit properties and sub items.
    * https://wpg.codeplex.com/
    * https://wpftoolkit.codeplex.com/wikipage?title=PropertyGrid
  * Corrupt and null save file check.

- Drag drop files direct into the interface.
  * Detect .vox files for asteroids.
  * Detect .sbc files for other content.
  * Detect 3D models?
  * Detect image files?

- Improve Import Image:
  * Preview (pan and zoom).
  * Orientation options.

- Improve Import 3D Model:
  * New volumetric conversion type calculate the slopes differently to create a more accurate conversion.
  * Import model colors or average model textures.
  * 3D Preview of Volmetric?
  * Orientation options.

- Mixed:
  * Import multiple ships/stations/objects from another 'world' as a group.  (Required to keep attached items. ie, Station/asteroid, Large Carrier/fighters.)
    Need a way to detect attached landing skids, or overlapping objects (sigh).  Check if landing gear activated?
  * Export and Import Asteroids/Floating Objects/Meteors to/from files.
  * Duplicate. Clone any object.
  * Group Move - Disperse over set area.
  * Duplicate any item.

- Character:
  * Exit Pilot from ship to Astronaut.
  * Replace missing tools.

- Asteroid:
  * Detect multiple objects in 3D import and allow assigning material to individal parts somehow.
  * Replace Asteroid/Voxel.
  * Rotate Asteroid/Voxel (not supported by sandbox currently, but procedural voxel rotation could be accomplished.)
  * Dialog to Generate box/sphere asteroid (size, hollow shell size, material).
  * Generate 'Random' asteroid field.
  * Improve the material mix in Asteroids somehow by creating clumps with the aim of optimising it along the cell boundaries.

- Items:

- Meteor:
  * Change size (mass).
  * Set/Reset Ship Vector. (specify Direction and specify Speed)
  * Set Meteor direction at specific object (calc correct center of object).

- Ship/Station:
  * Show ship status. Size. Item count. Weight. Thrust.
  * Switch power on/off.
  * Set/Reset Ship Vector. (specify Direction and specify Speed)
  * Replace user specified blocks with other user blocks (ie., by Armor light/heavy/color.)
  * Set Ship direction at specific object (calc correct center of object).
  * Finish Mirror calculations for final 2 window cubes.
  * Resize ship small<->large.
  * Subsystem editor.

- Asteroid Import 3D model.
- Remove the prebuilt asteroids.
- Splash screen (only whilst preloading data).
- Display list of all Cubes/Components/Items/Materials.
- Drag-Drop copy Meteors.

- Dialog to Create/Drop Components and Items (pipes, weapons, ingots, ores, ammos).
- Rotate ship/station cubes to face new orientation.
- Join two ship parts together after accidently breaking them apart.
- Group Move - move all to single point.
- Report of all in world assets.
  * Breakdown of all ores in untouched (in asteroid), unused (ore and ingot), used (component, tool, cube), npc (ore, ingot, component, tool, cube).
  * Counts of components, tools, cubes  (npc and non-npc).

Dropped:
- Obfuscate/dotfuscator. Don't think it's worth it, considering I've gone open source. :D
- Text Unicode support. Space Engineers doesn't appear to support Unicode.
  * testing text
  * テキストをテスト
  * 测试文字

References:

Offical file extensions in use.
".sba" Sand Box Audio. App content, MyObjectBuilder_XA2CueDefinition.
".sbc" Sand Box Content. Various app content, Blueprints, CubeBlocks, etc...
".sbc" Sand Box 'Checkpoint'. Game content, MyObjectBuilder_Checkpoint.
".sbl" Sand Box 'LastSession'. Game content, MyObjectBuilder_LastSession.
".sbs" Sand Box 'Sector'. Game content, MyObjectBuilder_Sector.
".sbw" Sand Box World. Zip compressed game world, used by workshop downloads.

Unoffical file extensions.
".sbo" Sand Box Object. I made this one up for import and export of ships (MyObjectBuilder_CubeGrid).  .sbc seemed like it would conflict with the other offical extensions.
  Though looking at content assets, prefab fighters use the ".sbc" extension which are MyObjectBuilder_CubeGrid, so I will change this now.
  Have now removed this file extension from use.


Why are the blocks 0.5 and 2.5 meter blocks?
Sectors have the same size as in Miner Wars: 50x50x50km. It would take a couple of minutes to get from one border to the other.
