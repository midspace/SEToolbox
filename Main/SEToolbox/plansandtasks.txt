TODO: list of tasks:
- Double the Voxel shell thickness and double count of 3D objects, and use this to generate the slopes/corners/inversecorners instead of trying to interpret them.
- Refresh/Save needs to check if save directory no longer exists.
- tree view.
- Property Grid.
- Close Dialog on IsModified.
- Auto Updater, detect current and available version, prompt for update.
- Wix installer project,
  * Desktop Icon.
- View subscribed workshop Items (to allow exporting/copying from).
  * C:\Users\%Username%\AppData\Roaming\SpaceEngineers\WorkshopWorlds\*.sbw  These are .zip files.
  * It's not until the user presses "Copy & Load" that it's acually saved there.
  * The workshopId may or may not be present, depending on if it is the first version, or a subsequent upload by the author.

- Improve Import Image:
  * Preview.
  * Scale.
- Improve Import 3D Model:
  * Recode Poly2Vox to VisualC CLR to integrate with app, and enhance.
  * 3D Preview?

- Exit Pilot from ship to Astronaut.
- Set/Reset Astronaut Vector. (Direction and Speed)
- Move Astronaut to position.
- Switch Jetpack on/off.
- Switch Inertia Dampeners on/off.

- Import multiple ships/stations/objects from another 'world' as a group.  (Required to keep attached items. ie, Station/asteroid, Large Carrier/fighters.)
  Need a way to detect attached landing skids, or overlapping objects (sigh).  Check if landing gear activated?

- Replace Asteroid/Voxel.
- Move Asteroid/Voxel.
- Rotate Asteroid/Voxel (not supported by sandbox currently, but procedual voxel rotation could be accomplished.)

- Show ship status. Size. Item count. Weight. Thrust.
- Switch power on/off.
- Switch Inertia Dampeners on/off.
- Set/Reset Ship Vector. (Direction and Speed)
- Move Ship to position.
- Replace Armor light/heavy/color.

========--------~~~~~~~~

Completed:
- Check if SpaceEngineers Game is installed first.
- Refresh button, to reload selected Sandbox content.
- Change Astronaut color.
- Import Image.
- Import 3D model.
- Delete ship/station/object.
- Show Ship Pilot/Roaming Astronaut status.
- Repair ship.
- Import Asteroid/Voxel.
- Link to open Workshop ID.
- Add collection for temporary files, to allow cleanup during shutdown.

========--------~~~~~~~~

Dropped:
- Obfuscate/dotfuscator. Don't think it's worth it, considering I've gone open source. :D
- Text Unicode support. SpaceEngineers doesn't appear to support Unicode.
  * testing text
  * テキストをテスト

Offical file extensions in use.
".sba" Sand Box Audio. App content, MyObjectBuilder_XA2CueDefinition.
".sbc" Sand Box Content. Various app content, Blueprints, CubeBlocks, etc...
".sbc" Sand Box 'Checkpoint'. Game content, MyObjectBuilder_Checkpoint.
".sbl" Sand Box 'LastSession'. Game content, MyObjectBuilder_LastSession.
".sbs" Sand Box 'Sector'. Game content, MyObjectBuilder_Sector.
".sbw" Sand Box World. Zip compressed game world, used by workshop downloads.

Unoffical file extensions.
".sbo" Sand Box Object. I made this one up for import and export of ships (MyObjectBuilder_CubeGrid).  .sbc seemed like it would conflict with the other offical extensions.
  Though looking at content assets, prefab fighters use the ".sbc" extension which are MyObjectBuilder_CubeGrid, so I will change this now.
  // TODO: remove this file extention from use in a couple of weeks.


Why are the blocks 0.5 and 2.5 meter blocks?
Sectors have the same size as in Miner Wars: 50x50x50km. It would take a couple of minutes to get from one border to the other.
