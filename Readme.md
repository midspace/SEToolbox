### No longer maintained or updated

I [midspace](https://github.com/midspace) have stopped working on Space Engineers related stuff.
There is a lengthy post [here](https://forum.keenswh.com/threads/7402115/) on the Keen forums about this decision.
I'm open to other developers taking over, or at least contributing further to SEToolbox.
